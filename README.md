# AmplitudemodulationFM

Aim

To implement and analyze amplitude modulation (AM) using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. 


Apparatus Required:

Software: Python with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

Hardware: Personal Computer

Theory

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, primarily for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal. The general form of an AM signal is:


Algorithm

1.	Initialize Parameters: Set the values for carrier frequency, message frequency, and sampling frequency.
2.	Generate Time Axis: Create a time vector for the signal duration.
3.	Generate Message Signal: Define the message signal as a cosine wave.
4.	Generate Carrier Signal: Define the carrier signal as a cosine wave.
5.	Modulate Signal: Apply the AM formula to obtain the modulated signal.
6.	Plot the Signals: Use Matplotlib to plot the message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal.

Result

The message signal, carrier signal, and amplitude modulated (AM) signal will be displayed in separate plots. Thus AM is implemented using numPy and Matplotlib.
